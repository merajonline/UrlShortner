I thought of two approaches
	1.Generating hashes for the fullUrl and storing them as key value pairs in redis cache or in postgres database
	2.Performing a Base62 conversion from Base10 on the id of stored fullUrl

		In case of hashes, sometimes the hashes can be longer than actual URL. 
		Another issue was the readability and ease of remembering. 
		So, I went with the second approach. With the Base conversion approach, 
		even the maximum value of Long produces 10 characters which is still somewhat easy to remember.
