I thought of two approaches
	1.Generating hashes for the fullUrl and storing them as key value pairs in redis cache or in postgres database
	2.Performing a Base62 conversion from Base10 on the id of stored fullUrl.
	3.Performing hashing on fullurl and then performing base62 approach on generated hash value.
	
		Base62 approach includes 62 characters which are a-z, A-Z and 0-9

		In case of hashes, sometimes the hashes can be longer than actual URL. 
		Another issue was the readability and ease of remembering. 
		So, I went with the second approach. With the Base conversion approach, 
		even the maximum value of Long produces 10 characters which is still somewhat easy to remember. 
		Even we can apply base62 approach for generated Long 10 characters to generate even small url of length 7 characters.
		
		
		
		
		
we can use redis which is persistent storage like cache and is very fast, for story fullurl and sort url as key value pair.
